# CS201-Projects
## Overview:
Collection of 5 course projects from CS201: Data Structures and Algorithms. These projects cover various fundamental algorithms and data structures implemented in C++, with an emphasis on performance analysis and optimization.

## Project Descriptions:
### Project 0: 
* Implemented Insertion Sort and Merge Sort algorithms
* Compared their experimental performance (based on actual execution time) with theoretical run time

### Project 1:
* Parsed input text files to collect word frequencies
* Utilized a multimap data structure to output unique words in descending order of frequency
* Used the chrono library to track execution time

### Project 2:
* Created a "Symbol Table" structure using a Red-Black Tree as the underlying data structure
* Replaced the multimap from Project 1 with the Symbol Table structure to compare performance

### Project 3:
* Parsed the given movie-actor database files using regex to build unordered maps
* Used unordered maps to store relationships between movies and actors, enabling the script to process a query file and search for actors by movie and/or movies by actor
* Tracked execution time for building data structures and query processing using the chrono library

### Project 4:
* Implemented breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms for the given graph structure
